//Bible for Software Engineers: Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
          Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
•	Core Idea: Good naming is essential. Code should tell a story without needing extra commentary.
•	Key Practices:
o	Names should be descriptive, specific, and pronounceable.
o	Avoid abbreviations or misleading terms.
o	Choose names that reveal intent — e.g., use getActiveAccount rather than getData.
•	Impact: Enhances readability and maintainability; reduces reliance on comments.
          Chapter 3: Functions
•	Core Idea: Functions should be small and do one thing only.
•	Best Practices:
o	Use meaningful names and limit arguments (prefer none or one).
o	Avoid side effects and deep nesting.
o	Structure functions for clarity, not cleverness.
•	Impact: Leads to modular, testable, and scalable code that’s easier to debug and refactor.
          Chapter 4: Comments
•	Core Idea: Comments are a last resort — code should ideally be self-expressive.
•	Proper Usage:
o	Use comments to explain why something is done, not what the code does.
o	Avoid redundant or misleading comments.
o	Prefer expressive naming and clean structure to reduce comment necessity.
•	Impact: Promotes transparency while discouraging clutter and outdated annotations.
          Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures
•	Core Idea: There’s a key trade-off between objects (behavior-focused) and data structures (data-focused).
•	Concepts:
o	Objects encapsulate behavior and hide data; structures expose data and hide behavior.
o	Understand when to use getters/setters vs. procedural access.
o	Favor principles like encapsulation and abstraction for complex systems.
•	Impact: Equips students to design architectures that balance clarity, flexibility, and control.
